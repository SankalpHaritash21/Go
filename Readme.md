# How to Run Go Files:

## steps:

### Prerequisites:

- Go installed on your system

### Compilation:

If you haven't done so already, you'll need to compile the Go files. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:

```sh
go build
This will generate an executable file in the current directory.

Execution:
Once the compilation is successful, you can run the generated executable by executing:


./<executable-name>
Replace <executable-name> with the name of the executable file generated by the compilation.

Alternatively, you can directly execute the Go files using the go run command. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:


go run <filename>.go
Replace <filename> with the name of the Go file you want to run.


```
